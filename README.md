Stable-Diffusion-API
Welcome to Image-generation-openai-api, a repository that demonstrates the use of OpenAI API to generate, edit, and manipulate images using JavaScript.

Introduction
This repository provides an example to call the OPENAI API to: generate, editing, and make variations of images using JavaScript. 

Installation
To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js and NPM
Once you have installed these software, you can clone the repository using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/FOGdotINC/Stable-DIffussion-API.git`

Then, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
`npm install`

Finally, create a file called .env in the root directory of the repository and add your OpenAI API key to it as follows:
`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key`

Usage
To use this repository, you can simply run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
`npm start`

This will start a local server that you can access at http://localhost:3000. Once you have accessed the server, you will see a simple interface that allows you to generate, edit, and manipulate images using OpenAI API and JavaScript.

Generating Images
To generate images based on text input, simply enter a description of the image you would like to generate in the input field and click the "Generate Image" button. The OpenAI API will then generate an image based on your input and display it on the screen.

Editing Images
To edit an existing image, simply upload the image path. You will then be presented with a number of editing tools that you can use to modify the image. Once you are happy with the changes, you can save the edited image to your computer.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository from anyone who is interested in using OpenAI API to generate, edit, and manipulate images using JavaScript. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. We will review your changes and merge them into the repository if they are appropriate.
